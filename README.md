# Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering Materials

This repository contains all the essential resources you need to complete a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, including:

- Notes  
- Lab materials  
- Free Udemy course `videos`  
- Other helpful resources  

## Important Notice 🚨

Previously, all the materials were shared through **OneDrive**, but due to storage issues the links are no longer accessible. Many students faced problems finding and downloading the files.  
I (the owner) am currently developing a **proper website** to make these materials easy to access and download.

👉 The development will take around **1 month**. After it’s ready, you can access everything here:  [ashalupreti.com.np/notes](https://www.ashalupreti.com.np/notes)
