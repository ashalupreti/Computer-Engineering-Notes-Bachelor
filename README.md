# Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering Materials

This repository contains all the materials you need to complete a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, including notes, lab materials, free Udemy course `videos` and other resources.

## Important Notice 🚨

Previously, all the materials were shared through **OneDrive**, but due to storage issues the links are no longer accessible. Many students faced problems finding and downloading the files.  
I (the owner) am currently developing a **proper website** to make these materials easy to access and download.

👉 The development will take around **1 month**. After it’s ready, you can access everything here:

Sorry for the inconvenience 🙏 and thank you for your patience.
